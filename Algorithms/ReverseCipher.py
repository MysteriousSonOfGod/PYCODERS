# Algorithm of Reverse Cipher
# The algorithm of reverse cipher holds the following features âˆ’
#
# Reverse Cipher uses a pattern of reversing the string of plain text to convert as cipher text.
#
# The process of encryption and decryption is same.
#
# To decrypt cipher text, the user simply needs to reverse the cipher text to get the plain text.

      print("Matched")
